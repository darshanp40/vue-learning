Slots - A mechanism by which we insert HTML inside a component directu=ly..
The contents get compiled and then showed in the final child component.
Note: all the properties need to be passed into the child from the parent need to be declared and defined inside the parents data object only
Only styles are the exception where in we define the styling in corresponding child component
