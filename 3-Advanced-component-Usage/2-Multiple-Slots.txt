// Also called as Named slots
Named slots allow multiple slots to be used in the same component
we just need to pass name attribute to the slots and in the parent component use slot attribute differentiate between 
the different components to be passed to different slots
e.g.
in child:>
<slot name="heading"></slot>
in Parent:>
<child-component>
    <h1 slot="heading">My Heading</h1>
</child-component>

we can pass default values in the slot as well. If a slot doesn't take a value then its default value would be shown
