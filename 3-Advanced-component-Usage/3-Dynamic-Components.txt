Dynamic components can be inserted into a parent component by using <component/> component where its a reserved component like slot
the <component /> expects the :is binding where the value of :is should be the name of the component to be loaded inside it dynamically


This can be helpful in creating tabs like structure

When switching between dynamic components, the component gets destroyed once the other component is loaded that is we navigate away from the
current component.
To override this default behaviour we need to wrap our <component /> inside <keep-alive /> component.

Dynamic components lifecycle hooks:
1. deactivated
2. activated
